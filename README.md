## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking and enhanced development experience.
- **SCSS**: For advanced styling and theming.
- **React Router**: For handling routing within the application.


## Project Setup

### 1. Adding JSON Data

- Place your JSON data file in the `public` folder. This data represents various metrics of developer activities.

### 2. Creating Services

- **Services**: Create services for handling data operations. This project includes `dataServices` and `userServices`. Although data is currently static, these services are structured to allow easy integration with APIs in the future.

### 3. Code Structure

- **Services**: Contains logic for fetching and managing data.
  - `dataServices.ts`
  - `userServices.ts`

- **Components**: Modular components for building the UI.
  - `Cards/`
  - `Charts/`
  - `Shared/`

- **Constants**: Store constant data and configurations.
  - `cardDetails.ts`
  - `iconsDetails.ts`
  - `insight.ts`

- **Utils**: Common utility functions for various operations.
  - `totalCalculation.ts`
  - `chartData.ts`
  - `cardData.ts`

- **Store**: State management using Redux.
  - `store.ts`
  - `theme.slice.ts` (handles dark/light mode functionality)

### 4. Styling

- **SCSS**: Styling is managed using SCSS. The structure mirrors the component organization for consistency.
  - `styles/`
    - `components/`
      - `Cards/`
      - `Charts/`
      - `Dashboard/`
      - `Shared/`
    - `global.scss` (defines colors, font sizes, and global styles)
    - `utils.scss` (provides utilities for layout, flexbox, grid, responsiveness)

### 5. TypeScript Interfaces

- **Interfaces**: Define the structure of data and props used in the project.
  - `components/`
    - `Card.ts`
  - `utils/`
    - `total.ts`
    - `totalCalculation.ts`

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install project dependencies.

2. **Start the Development Server**: Run `npm start` or `yarn run dev` to launch the development server with hot module replacement (HMR).

3. **Build the Project**: Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create a production build.
